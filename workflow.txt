# Areas still needed to be modeled for chatbot:

## Medical question database redirecting 
### Basic Areas that bot should be able to talk about:

#### areas of improvement so far:

##### Code for spefic answers chains for both medical and non-medical questions.
##### Have chatbot (free question answer) function as a something else option to suplment block answers.
##### Have block answers primarily function to give answer chains
##### common questions just type in responses rather then doing an if then statement esc thing.
##### create a way to output common responses as well to questions.


##### Make responses less long winded and more interactive
##### Make responses better at leading into new questions (Done with followsups being listed)


## Generic APP questions
### Basic Areas that the bot should be able to talk about:
#### Interphase locations
#### What data that is shown is
#### What x is
#### Where x is
#### Basic questions about the wearable
#### Some trouble shooting questions

## Expand the workflow in which the bot can communicate
### Bot should be able to answer questions about itself
#### privacy
#### how it works
#### how the bot learns
#### 

## expand bot responces to questions to make bot not seem super repatative (consider 10 responces for each subject.)

Workflow:
First few options for bot:
Hi, I'm new user, need help with medical thing, need help with interphase, want to give feedback, something else

Hi responses lead into:
Need help with medical thing, need help with interphase, want to give feedback, something else


Note:
Add way for postive and negative responses to just have the same follow ups as before having typed them when done.







Question?

4 most asked questions?
Nope bad idea due to branching, stem questions will always be chosen first. 


Should there be a take me back option?
So if I were to ask a question, get my answer, and that brought up a new idea should I be able to move backwards to an older response? 
I say yes, because that is the type of quality of life stuff that brings enjoyment in using something.
