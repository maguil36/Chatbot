## Generic APP questions
### Basic Areas that the bot should be able to talk about:
#### Interphase locations
#### What data that is shown is

#### Where x is
#### Basic questions about the wearable
#### Some trouble shooting questions

## Expand the workflow in which the bot can communicate
### Bot should be able to answer questions about itself

#### how the bot learns
#### 

## expand bot responces to questions to make bot not seem super repatative (consider 10 responces for each subject.)
